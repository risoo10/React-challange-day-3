# Personal REACT Challenge (Day 3 and 4) - My to do App (React + Firebase)

## Personal challenge
I commited myself to get better with React and started 
this challange to create **one simple react app** every 
single day for the next 7 days. 

I was only a beginner at the beginning, I read few tutorials
on the web, but I wanted to know how I can fully work with 
React. So I started this challenge.

I expect to get real know-how of React and start thinking
in "Component-State-Props" philosophy. 

My challange consisted of:
- HTML Markup
- CSS styling with Styled Components
- REACT interactions, components, states

## Firebase
For this challange I decided to use firebase realtime database and hosting to create real and working public app so data is always saved in the database.

This app was little bit too hard for me to crack in just one day, so I split the work in 2 days.

## Day 3 - My to do list app (delete, toggle)
I created the basic setup of components.
I styled the part of displaying lists and then tasks for selected list. The data was faked and only lived in the states and props in components. Basic functionality was made to delete and toggle to-do items. I also styled the look.

## Day 4 - Create new todo item + Firebase 
Next day I finished styling and functionality of the inputing new to-do item to the selected list. Then I created project in my Firebase console and configured the connection from the app to the database. 
Functionality was lifted down to the lower level components and app was lisenning for changes to rerender app in App component.
Finally I build and deployed app to Firebase hosting and made it public (link bellow).
